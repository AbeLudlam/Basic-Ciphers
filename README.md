# Project 1 - Classical Ciphers
This project is able to encode and decode strings made of all lowercase letters when given a key. Ciphers that work are playfair ciphers, dollar ciphers, vigenere ciphers, and ceasar ciphers.

The program only displays the structure of the playfair ciphers as it is the most complicated of the bunch. As such only its plaintext to ciphertext strings are displayed.
