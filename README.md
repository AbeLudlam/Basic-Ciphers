# Project 1 - Classical Ciphers
This project is able to encode and decode strings made of all lowercase letters when given a key. Ciphers that work are playfair ciphers, dollar ciphers, vigenere ciphers, and ceasar ciphers.

The program only displays the structure of the Playfair ciphers as it is the most complicated of the bunch. As such only its plaintext to ciphertext strings are displayed.

I did most of the work on classicalcipher.hh, with all the work of the Playfair cipher done by myself.
My Professor, Kevin Wortman, did the work on classicalcipher_test.cpp for us to test and run our encoding programs.

Suggest using the Makefile to create the executable. Command line input of the makefile is below:

 classicalcipher.hh classicalcipher_test.cpp
 c++ --std=c++11 classicalcipher_test.cpp -o classicalcipher_test
  
 ExampleExe is given just in case
